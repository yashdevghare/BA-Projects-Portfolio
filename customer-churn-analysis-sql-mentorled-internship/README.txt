# Customer Churn Analysis – Digital Banking Domain

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my **mentor-led internship with Jupiter (via upGrad)** in the **digital banking domain**.  
The aim was to identify **key drivers of customer churn**, understand the underlying patterns, and recommend targeted retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In the competitive banking sector, customer attrition (churn) leads to significant revenue loss and higher acquisition costs.  
The bank observed an increasing churn rate and engaged in a **customer analytics initiative** to:

- Analyse historical customer data
- Identify patterns and churn risk segments
- Recommend **actionable strategies** to improve customer retention

---

## 📂 Dataset Details
**Dataset Name:** `Bank_Churn_Dataset.csv`  
**Records:** 10,000+ customers  
**Key Features:**
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Geography)
- Account details (Balance, Tenure, Products, Credit Score)
- Banking relationship (Active status, Number of products)
- Exit status (Exited = 1 indicates churned customer)

---

## 🛠 Approach & Methodology

### 1. Data Understanding
- Reviewed dataset schema and data dictionary
- Identified churn definition: `Exited = 1`

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values
- Converted categorical values for SQL analysis
- Created **derived metrics**:
  - Age Groups
  - Balance Buckets
  - Credit Score Ranges
  - Tenure Categories
  - Product Holding Segments

### 3. SQL-Based Analysis
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution of churn across demographics
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Churn rate by age group, credit score, geography
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Combined effects (e.g., Senior customers with low credit score)
- Segmentation to identify **high-risk customer profiles**

---

## 📊 Key Insights

| Factor | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Geography** | Customers from certain regions showed churn rates above 35% |
| **Age** | Senior customers (60+) and young customers (<25) had higher churn |
| **Credit Score** | Low credit score (<500) customers churned at ~40% rate |
| **Balance** | Zero-balance customers more likely to churn |
| **Products** | Single-product holders churned more than multi-product holders |
| **Activity** | Inactive customers churned significantly more than active customers |

---

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Targeted Retention Campaigns**  
   Focus on high-risk segments: low credit score, zero-balance, inactive customers

2. **Product Bundling**  
   Offer cross-selling opportunities to single-product customers

3. **Engagement Programs**  
   Improve customer interaction for inactive accounts

4. **Credit Score Improvement Plans**  
   Educate and assist customers with low credit scores

5. **Regional Strategies**  
   Investigate and address specific pain points in high-churn regions

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – For all data querying, filtering, and analysis  
- **MS Excel** – For additional segmentation and summarization  
- **Data Analysis Techniques** – Univariate, Bivariate, Segmentation Analysis  
- **Business Analytics Frameworks** – Data-driven decision-making

---

## 📄 Files in Repository
- `Bank_Churn_Dataset.csv` – Original dataset
- `Complete_Code_Customer_Churn_Analysis.sql` – Full SQL code for analysis
- `insights_and_recommendations_report.pdf` – Detailed findings & strategies
- `review_report_of_selected_metrics.pdf` – Metric-wise churn review

---

## 🏆 Outcome
The analysis provided **clear churn driver identification** and **actionable retention strategies**.  
If implemented, the recommendations can **reduce churn by an estimated 10–15%**, leading to increased revenue and stronger customer loyalty.
