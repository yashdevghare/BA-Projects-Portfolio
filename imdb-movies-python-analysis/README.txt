# 🎬 IMDb Movies Analysis with Python (1916–2016)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores a century of movies (1916–2016) using **Python**.  
The analysis focuses on identifying trends across **movies, actors, directors, genres, ratings, and box-office collections**, and delivering actionable insights from the dataset.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and explore the IMDb-like movie dataset.
- Answer guided questions from the provided Jupyter Notebook.
- Surface insights on **top movies**, **prolific artists**, **genre trends**, and **revenue patterns**.
- Present clean, well-structured Python code and outputs.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **File:** `imdb-movies-raw+data.csv`  
- **Period:** 1916–2016  
- **Columns:** title, year, genre(s), director, cast, rating, votes, gross/collection (depending on data)

---

## 🛠️ Tech & Libraries
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`  

---

## 🔍 What’s Covered (Notebook Tasks)
- Data loading, inspection, and cleaning (missing values, duplicates, type fixes)
- Feature engineering (splitting multi-genre, extracting year)
- Descriptive statistics & trend analysis
- Top-N analyses:
  - Highest-rated / most-voted movies
  - Most prolific directors and actors
  - Genre popularity over decades
- Correlations (ratings vs votes vs collections)
- Insights summarized after each major task

---

## 📈 Sample Insights
- **Genres:** Action, Drama, and Comedy dominate both volume and revenue.  
- **Directors:** A few prolific directors consistently achieve higher-than-average ratings.  
- **Actors:** Frequent collaborations often correlate with better ratings.  
- **Ratings & Revenue:** Stronger correlation between **votes** and revenue than ratings alone.  
- **Decadal Trends:** Significant shifts in genre preferences post-2000.
